# Devon module Developer's Guide

Here, we intend to explain, creation of a maven module (devonfw module) , which will serve as template for creating other modules.
This is done with usage of maven archetype plugin.
Please, follow subsequent sections, for creation of same.

== Creation of module template

The maven Archetype Plugin allows the user to create a Maven project from an existing template called an archetype.
It also allows the user to create an archetype from an existing project.

Creating an archetype from an existing project involves three steps:

* the archetype resolution
* the archetype installation:deployment
* the archetype usage

*1.* Using devon distribution's,_console.bat_,open console and go to directory where project exists ,and then execute command 
[source,java]
----
mvn archetype:create-from-project
----



*2.* It then generates the directory tree of the archetype in the target/generated-sources/archetype directory.


*3.* Then move to mentioned directory above and execute,
[source,java]
----
mvn install
----

SO, this step, installs created archetype in users local maven repository.

== Usage

We can use created archetype(template) from eclipse as well as command line.
If one wants to create project using archetype in eclipse, follow below steps:

Go to File-->New-->Maven Project

Select archetype.

For the very first time, when we use archetype in eclipse, it sometimes does not appear in the list of available archetypes.So in that case, use _"add archetype"_ button .

Once you select archetype,and press "_Next_" button, a dialog appears, where you need to put desired artifactid and group id and click finish.
A new project is created on the basis of chosen archetype.
