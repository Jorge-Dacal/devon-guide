== Release: improving & strengthening
 
We are proud to announce the immediate release of *devonfw version 2.3* (code named “_Dash_” during development).  This release comes with a bit of a delay as we decided to wait for the publication of OASP4j 2.5. “Dash” contains a slew of new features but in essence it is already driven by what we expect to be the core focus of 2018: strengthening the platform and improving quality.

After one year and a half of rapid expansion, we expect the next release(s) of the devonfw 2.x series to be fully focused on deepening the platform rather than expanding it. That is to say: we should work on improving existing features rather than adding new ones and strengthen the qualitative aspects of the software development life cycle, i.e. testing, infrastructure (CI, provisioning) etc.

“Dash” already is very much an example of this. This release contains the Allure Test Framework as an incubator. This is an automated testing framework for functional testing of web applications. Another incubator is the devonfw Shop Floor which intended to be a compilation of DevOps experiences from the Devonfw perspective. And based on this devonfw has been _OpenShift Primed_ (“certified”) by Red Hat. 

There is a whole range of new features and improvements which can be seen in that light. OASP4j 2.5 changes and imrproves the package structure of the core Java framework. The My Thai Star sample app has now been fully integrated in the different frameworks and the devonfw Guide has once again been significantly expanded and improved. 

== An industrialized platform for the ADcenter

Although less visible to the overall devonfw community, an important driving force was (meaning that lots of work has been done in the context of) the creation of the ADcenter concept towards the end of 2017. Based on a radical transformation of on/near/offshore software delivery, the focus of the ADcenters is to deliver agile & accelerated “Rightshore” services with an emphasis on:

* Delivering Business Value and optimized User Experience
* Innovative software development with state of the art technology
* Highly automated devops; resulting in lower costs & shorter time-to-market

The first two ADcenters, in Valencia (Spain) and Bangalore (India), are already servicing clients all over Europe - Germany, France, Switzerland  and the Netherlands - while ADcenter aligned production teams are currently working for Capgemini UK as well (through Spain).Through the ADcenter, Capgemini establishes industrialized innovation; designed for & with the user. The availability of platforms for industrialized software delivery like devonfw and the Production Line has allowed us to train and make available over a 150 people in very short time. 

The creation of the ADcenter is such a short time is visible proof that we´re getting closer to a situation where devonfw and Production Line are turning into the default development platform for APPS2, thereby standardizing all aspects of the software development life cycle: from training and design, architecture, devops and development,  all the way up to QA and deployment.
