Devon4Sencha is an alternative view layer for web applications developed with Devon Framework. It is based on the proprietary libraries developed by http://www.sencha.com[Sencha]. As it requires a license for commercial applications it won't be provided as Open Source (The companion OASP project).

These libraries provide support for creating SPA (Single Page Applications) with a very rich set of components for both desktop and mobile. They also provide a clear programming model based on the MVC and MVVM patterns. Visit their http://www.sencha.com[website] for more examples on this.

Devon4Sencha builds on top of Sencha libraries to further standardize the way applications are created and to seamlessly integrate with the back-end application. We provide:

* Basic application template
* Basic layout for a tabbed based interface
* Login and session management
* Internationalization
* Better organization of source code (following Sencha MVC pattern)
* Ajax communication simplification
