= Creating New Application

.*Using devcon*
[NOTE]
You can automate the following steps using devcon with the `devon oasp4j create` command link:devcon-user-guide#oasp4j-create[learn more here]

== Running the archetype

In order to create a new application, you must use the archetype provided by devon who uses the maven archetype functionality.

To use the archetype, there are 2 alternatives, one is to create it from command line or, in more visual manner, within eclipse.

=== From command Line

==== Step 1: Open the console

Open the Devonfw console by executing the batch file _console.bat_ from the Devonfw distribution. This will open a command prompt preconfigured automatically to use the software and configuration provided by the Devonfw distribution.

==== Step 2: Change the directory

You can create the project wherever you want, but it is a good practice to create the projects into your `workspace` directory. Therefore, run the following command in the console to change to the directory to `workspaces\main`.

[source,bash]
----
cd workspaces\main
----

This is the default location on Devonfw to create new applications. It is also possible to have your own workspace.

==== Step 3: Create the new application

To create a new application you need to execute one of the following commands:


** WAR packaging (arguments before archetype:generate identify the OASP4J archetype):
+
[source,bash]
---- 
mvn -DarchetypeVersion=<OASP4J-VERSION> -DarchetypeGroupId=io.oasp.java.templates -DarchetypeArtifactId=oasp4j-template-server archetype:generate -DgroupId=<APPLICATION-GROUP-ID> -DartifactId=<APPLICATION-ARTIFACT-ID> -Dversion=<APPLICATION-VERSION> -Dpackage=<APPLICATION-PACKAGE-NAME>
---- 
+
For example 
+
[source,bash]
---- 
mvn -DarchetypeVersion=2.1.0 -DarchetypeGroupId=io.oasp.java.templates -DarchetypeArtifactId=oasp4j-template-server archetype:generate -DgroupId=io.oasp.application -DartifactId=sampleapp -Dversion=0.1-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=io.oasp.application.sampleapp
---- 
//////////////////////////////////////////
** And for combined WAR and EAR packaging (arguments before archetype:generate identify the OASP4J archetype):
+
[source]
---- 
mvn -DarchetypeVersion=2.1.0 -DarchetypeGroupId=io.oasp.java.templates -DarchetypeArtifactId=oasp4j-template-server archetype:generate -DgroupId=io.oasp.application -DartifactId=sampleapp -Dversion=0.1-SNAPSHOT -Dpackage=io.oasp.application.sampleapp -DearProjectName=enterprise-ear
---- 
//////////////////////////////////////////
This will create a new directory inside `workspaces\main` with the name of your application with the created application inside.

=== From Eclipse

[NOTE]
====
If you use a proxy to connect to the Internet, the following will not work, as Eclipse has a known bug where the archetype discovery does not work behind a proxy. In this case, please use the command line version documented above.
====

To create a new application with Eclipse, you should have installed https://coconet.capgemini.com/sf/frs/do/listReleases/projects.apps2_devon/frs.devon_distribution[Devonfw distribution]. Then follow below steps to create new application:

==== Step 1 - Create a new Maven Project

Open Eclipse from a Devonfw distribution, by executing the batch file "eclipse-main.bat", and go to _File > New > Maven Project_. If you don't see the option, click _File > New > Other_ and use the filter to search the option _Maven Project_

==== Step 2 -  Choose the archetype

In the New Maven Project wizard you need to choose the _oas4j-template-server archetype_, as shown in below image.

[NOTE]
====
If you are not able to have access to the archetype even after checking the _Include snapshot archetypes_ option try adding manually the archetype repository. You can do it with the _Configure_ button located next to the _Catalogs_ dropdown and then clicking the _Add Remote Catalog_ button. Finally you will need to add the repository URL _https://repo1.maven.org/maven2_ and as _Description_ you can use _Maven Central_.

Use the _Verify_ button to check the connection. After that you should see a message with the amount of found archetypes.

[Archetype]

==== Step 3 - Configure the application properties

Fill the _Group Id_, _Artifact Id_, _Version_ and _Package_ for your project. 
//////////////////////////////////////////
If you want to add an EAR generation mechanism to your project, you should fill the property _earProjectName_ with the value _Artifact Id_ + "-ear". For example, "sampleapp-ear". 

If you only want a WAR generation, you can remove the property _earProjectName_.

* Click on the Finish button and your project is ready for execution.
