* The structure that we need to follow when we work in the wiki is the next: 

= Level 1 (=)
Text.

== Level 2 (==)
Text.

=== Level 3 (===)
Text.

==== Level 4 (====)
Text.

===== Level 5 (=====)

* Avoid the '#' character in levels use always '='

* For quotation marks avoid:

** U+201C LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK (“) and U+201D RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK (”)

** Use instead U+0022 QUOTATION MARK (")

*Avoid characters like ?, () or & in the headers.

* The size of the images and links of this image -> the max size we need to use is [,width="450", link="https://github.com/devonfw/devon-guide/wiki/<image>"], if you need to use less go ahead but never more.
