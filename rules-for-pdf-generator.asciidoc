== Structure

=== Requirements

The structure that we need to follow when we work in the wiki is the next: 

= Level 1 (=)
Text.

== Level 2 (==)
Text.

=== Level 3 (===)
Text.

==== Level 4 (====)
Text.

===== Level 5 (=====)

=== Limitations

The pdf generator tool uses the structure of each wiki page to generate the structure of the pdf sections, taking each Level title as an ID which implies some limitations when structuring our page:

* Level 1 (=) must be unique in each wiki page, you can use it to add the main title of the page and for each section or chapter you can use the Level 2 (==).

* We can not repeat titles with the same Level (e.g. we can not use in the same page `== Something` twice, instead we should use `== Something A` and `== Something B`).

== Characters

* Avoid the `#` character in levels use always `=`

* For quotation marks avoid:

** U+201C LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK (`“`) and U+201D RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK (`”`)

** Use instead U+0022 QUOTATION MARK (`"`)

[NOTE]
====
Be very careful when copying and pasting text from documents and webs to the wiki, the _double quotation mark_ characters are very common in these type of resources.
====

*Avoid characters like `?`, `()` or `&` in the headers (titles) of the sections.

== Images

=== basic structure
`image::images/<topic>/image.png[,width="450",link="images/<topic>/image.png"]`

=== max size
'width=450' is the maximum size for images to be showed properly in the PDF.
