* The structure that we need to follow when we work in the wiki is the next: 

= Level 1 (=)
Text.

== Level 2 (==)
Text.

=== Level 3 (===)
Text.

==== Level 4 (====)
Text.

===== Level 5 (=====)


== Characters

* Avoid the '#' character in levels use always '='

* For quotation marks avoid:

** U+201C LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK (“) and U+201D RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK (”)

** Use instead U+0022 QUOTATION MARK (")

[NOTE]
====
Be very careful when copying and pasting text from documents and webs to the wiki, the _double quotation mark_ characters are very common in these type of resources.
====

*Avoid characters like ?, () or & in the headers.

== Images

=== basic structure
`image::images/<topic>/image.png[,width="450",link="images/<topic>/image.png"]`

=== max size
'width=450' is the maximum size for images to be showed properly in the PDF.
