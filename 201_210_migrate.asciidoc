= Migrating from DevonFW 2.0.1 to DevonFW 2.1.0

== Devon4Sencha

== OASP4J

== CobiGen

Regarding CobiGen, there is no need to update anything. The 2.1.0 release only adds new functionalities to the CobiGen plugin as:

. Sencha Client Generation
. Sencha Architect project generation
. SpringData at server side intead of JPA if wanted
. Some fixes regarding the inner code of the plugin itslef already included at the distribution

CobiGen can't be used for existent projects of Sencha because he uses a particular nomenclature that all the projects generated by him must follow. In order to create/generate a new Sencha client https://github.com/devonfw/tools-cobigen/wiki/sencha-gen#sencha-work-space-and-app[this steps] must be followed.
