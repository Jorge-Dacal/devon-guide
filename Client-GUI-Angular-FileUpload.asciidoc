ng2-uploader is a set of service and directives. It is designed for uploading the files in Angular2 applications.

*Installation via npm*

[source,bash]
----
npm install ng2-uploader --save
----

*Installation via cloning repository from GitHub*

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/jkuri/ng2-uploader.git
----

Importing ng2-uploader in your app

[source,bash]
----
import { UPLOAD_DIRECTIVES } from 'ng2-uploader';
----

We need to apply *NgFileSelect* to input element of type file and bind handleUpload(data: any) handler to it. Also, we need to apply options we declared to that input.



= Syncronous File Upload

To enable multiple files upload we need to add multiple attribute to input of type file and it is enabled automatically.
And the template would look something like:

[source,bash]
----
<input type="file" 
            multiple="true"
            ngFileSelect
            [options]="options" 
            (onUpload)="handleMultipleUpload($event)">

<p *ngIf="response.length">
   <span>Progress{{ progress }}%</span>
   <span>{{ response }}</span>
</p>

= Asyncronous File Upload

For asynchronous file upload, the template would look something like:

[source,bash]
----
<input type="file" 
       ngFileSelect
       [options]="basicOptions" 
       (onUpload)="handleUpload($event)">

<div>
  Response: {{ response | json }}
</div>

<div>
  Progress: {{ progress }}%
</div>
