= Syncronous File Upload

To enable multiple files upload we need to add multiple attribute to input of type file and it is enabled automatically.
And the template would look something like:

[source,bash]
----
<input type="file" 
            multiple="true"
            ngFileSelect
            [options]="options" 
            (onUpload)="handleMultipleUpload($event)">

<p *ngIf="response.length">
   <span>Progress{{ progress }}%</span>
   <span>{{ response }}</span>
</p>

----
