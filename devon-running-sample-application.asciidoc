= Running sample application

Devon comes with a sample application, which showcases the most common features of Devon and its proposed best practices.

The sample application also serves as a final test to make sure that your environment is setup correctly.

The following steps assume that you have already setup your Devon environment.

1. Select "File - Import"

1. Select "Maven - Existing Maven Projects"

1. Click "Finish"

1. Right-click on "Tomcat" and select "Start"

1. After some time the server state should switch to "Started, Synchronized"

At this point the server-side of the sampel application is running, although the user interface (the client) is still missing.

You can check if it is working by opening a browser and going to http://localhost:8081/devonfw-sample-server/services[]. Use "chief" as user and password. It should show you a listing of available services.
