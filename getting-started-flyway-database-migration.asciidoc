= Setting up and maintaining database schemas with Flyway


 
https://flywaydb.org/documentation/[Flyway]  is an open-source database migration tool. It strongly favors simplicity and convention over configuration.

== Why we use flyway?

Lets say we have our software and our database. Great. And this could very well all you need. 

But on most projects, this simple view of the world very quickly translates into this

We not only have to deal with one copy of environment, but with several. This presents a number of challenges. 

Many projects still rely on manually applied sql scripts. And sometimes not even that (a quick sql statement here or there to fix a problem). And soon many questions arise:
* What state is the database in on this machine?
** Has this script already been applied or not?
*** Has the quick fix in production been applied in test afterwards?
**** How do you set up a new database instance?

More often than not the answer to these questions is: We don't know. 

Database migrations are a great way to regain control of this mess.

They allow you to:
•Recreate a database from scratch
•Make it clear at all times what state a database is in
•Migrate in a deterministic way from your current version of the database to a newer one
