= OASP4Fn Application Deplyment
The deployment is performed by the serverless framework and it is quite simple, since the only command needed to deploy the full service is the following one:

[source, bash]
----
sls deploy
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
This command will fail if the AWS credentials are missing. For more information visit https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/[serverless credentials]
====

When the deployment is finished with no errors, the user will receive the result via command line output with details as the endpoints and the functions deployed.

[NOTE]
====
For more information about the deployment process visit the https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/deploy/[serverless documentation], but be aware that OASP4Fn doesn't support the deployment of a single function..
