= My Thai Star

Devonfw showcases "My Thai Start" as a sample application, which has the most common features of a Devonfw application and its proposed best practices. The sample application also serves as a final test to make sure that your environment is setup correctly. Devonfw distribution comes with a latest Master version of My Thai Star application. 

== Basics 
The _My Thai Star_ application is a solution for managing the online booking and orders of a restaurant, it is addressed as a showcase app but designed with real requirements although trying to serve as example of common use cases in web apps (master-detail model, login, authorization based on roles, pagination, search with filters, etc.).

Setup Devonfw environment and follow the below steps:

== Running Sample Application

=== Server

All Spring boot application have their own embedded Tomcat server. This feature help us to deploy the application in the develop time without the need to create an server. To run the application with this mode, you need to open Eclipse of your Devonfw distribution and perform the following steps:

==== Step 1: Import the project

First of all, import above Sample Application into Eclipse using the following steps:

1. Open Eclipse by executing "eclipse-main.bat" from "_Devon-dist_" folder.

1. Select "File -> Import".

1. Select "Maven -> Existing Maven Projects" as shown below:

1. Select the directory "workspaces/examples/my-thai-star" as shown below and later press "OK":

1. Then press "Finish".

1. Wait for Eclipse to finish importing the sample projects. This process might take several minutes, depending on the speed of your internet connection.

==== Step 2: Run the application

Using _Spring Boot_ features,  run your _Java_ backend applications using the _Run as -> Java application_ over the _SpringBootApp.java_ main class as shown below:

image::images/running-sample-application/run.png[,width="450", link="images/running-sample-application/run.png"]

Once, you see the console messages like : 

----
Tomcat started on port(s): 8081 (http)
Started SpringBootApp in 15.985 seconds (JVM running for 16.833)
----

you can start consuming the _Java_ backend.

==== Step 3: Test the application

To see the backend services results, you can use https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop[Postman] plugin for _Chrome_, although you can use any other similar application.

Now, with _Postman_, you can do a simple _GET_ request to obtain the information of a _dish_ with _id=1_ (`http://localhost:8081/mythaistar/services/rest/dishmanagement/v1/dish/1`). And you will get a result like this:

Now, Server is running successfully!!!

=== Client

==== Step 1: Install Dependencies

*Make sure that the SERVER is Up and Running!*

To run MyThaiStar front-end, you need to globally install the following dependencies:

1. https://nodejs.org/en/[Node], 
1. https://github.com/angular/angular-cli[Angular CLI]
1. https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/[Yarn]

Once you have installed above dependencies, you can go to the project folder 

_"workspaces\examples\my-thai-star\angular"_

and execute the following command:

[source,bash]
----
yarn install 
----

After finishing, you will see something like:

image::images/running-sample-application/yarn_install.png[, link="images/running-sample-application/yarn_install.png"]

OR, 

execute the following command:

[source,bash]
----
npm install
----

==== Step 2: Run the application

Now, you are ready to run the client using

[source,bash]
----
ng serve
----

If everything goes well, the console output will be something like this:

image::images/running-sample-application/webpack.JPG[, link="images/running-sample-application/webpack.JPG"]

==== Step 3: Test the application

Now, go to your browser and open 

[source,bash]
----
localhost:4200
----

and you can see MyThaiStar client running! You can login to the application using 

*username*: waiter

*passowrd*: waiter

as shown below:
