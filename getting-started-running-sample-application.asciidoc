= Sample Application

Devonfw comes with a sample application, which showcases the most common features of an Devon application and its proposed best practices. The sample application also serves as a final test to make sure that your environment is setup correctly. 

This section explains how to download the sample application and run it. Setup Devonfw environment and follow the below steps:

== Downloading Sample Application

First of all, download or clone the application from the https://github.com/oasp/oasp4j[GitHub repository]. We recommend to use the Git Bash to work with our repository of GitHub. You can download Git and Git Bash for Windows system https://git-for-windows.github.io/[here]. Also you can learn more about the best practices of work with Git and GitHub on Devonfw https://github.com/devonfw/devon/wiki/devon-guide-working-with-git-and-github[here].

To clone the repository, open the Git Bash console and run the following command:

[source,console]
----
git clone https://github.com/devonfw/devon.git
----

Now, let's discuss how to run the Sample Application. 

== Running Sample Application

We can run the application in two ways or whatever other Devon application based on Spring boot: https://github.com/devonfw/devon-guide/wiki/getting-started-running-sample-application#embedded-tomcat-server[Running with the embedded Tomcat 8 server of Spring Boot] or https://github.com/devonfw/devon-guide/wiki/getting-started-running-sample-application#external-tomcat-server[using an external Tomcat 8 server].

=== Embedded Tomcat server

All Spring boot application have their own embedded Tomcat server. This feature help us to deploy the application in the develop time without the need to create an server. To run the application with this mode, you need to open Eclipse of your Devonfw distribution and perform the following steps:

==== Step 1: Import the project

First of all, import above Sample Application into Eclipse using the following steps:

1. Open Eclipse by executing "eclipse-main.bat"

1. Select "File - Import"

1. Select "Maven - Existing Maven Projects"

1. Select the directory "workspaces/examples/oasp4j/samples

1. Press "Finish"

1. Wait for Eclipse to finish importing the sample project. This process might take several minutes, depending on the speed of your internet connection.

==== Step 2: Run the application

The embedded Tomcat server of the Spring Boot Application can be running with a simple right click on the Java file *oasp4j-sample-core/src/main/java/io/oasp/gastronomy/restaurant/SpringBootApp.java* > Run as... > 2 Java Application

Now you can open you favorite browser and see the Sample Application running in the next URL  

[source]
----
http://localhost:8081/oasp4j-sample-server/
----

As you can see, this embedded server is a very comfortable way to start the application. When you run the application with this server, you need to take in to account that the application is using the properties of the _application.properties_ file in the *src/main/resources/config* folder.

=== External Tomcat server

Normally we want to deploy our application in a external server, so we can do this on Eclipse, creating a new server. The steps to run an OASP4J application in an external Tomcat server are the next:

==== Step 1: Create new Tomcat server

* Open the Server view in Eclipse if you don't have it opened (main menu -> Windows -> Show View -> Servers). 

* In servers view do right click -> New -> Server

* In the wizard panel you need to configure the server as Tomcat 8 and press Next.

It's possible that Eclipse ask you for the path of Tomcat 8. If you don't have Tomcat 8 in your distribution of Devonfw you can download it https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi[here] and extract the zip in the software folder of your distribution. 

==== Step 2: Add the application in the server

Now we need to go to the Server View and do right click in your new Tomcat 8 server -> Add and Remove... -> add the oasp4j-sample-server -> Finish.

==== Step 3: Run the server

Now we need to press Run or Debugg in the Server View with our new Tomcat server selected. And the application will be deployed by the server.

Now you can open you favorite browser and see the Sample Application running in the next URL 

[source]
----
http://localhost:8080/oasp4j-sample-server/
----

As you can see the port is 8080, but you can modify this properties in the Tomcat server properties (double click over the server in the _Servers_ view) or in *src/main/resources/application.properties*. You need to take into account that this are the properties that the application will use if you deploy the application in the context of an external Tomcat server.
