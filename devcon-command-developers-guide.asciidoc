= Devcon Command Developer's guide

== Introduction

link:devcon-user-guide[Devcon] is a cross-platform command line and GUI tool running on the JVM that provides many automated tasks around the full life-cycle of Devonfw applications.

The structure of Devcon is formed by two main elements: modules and commands.

where each module represents an area of Devon and groups commands that are related to some specific task of that area.

After link:devcon-user-guide#getting-started-download-devcon[installing Devcon] you can see the modules and commands available out of the box opening a command line and using the command `devon -g` to launch the Devcon's graphic user interface.

[NOTE]
====
Using the command line and the command `devon -h` (even using only the keywork `devon` or `devcon` the result) and `devon <module> -h` will show the same information.
