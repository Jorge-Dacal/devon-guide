= Environment Setup

In this section you will learn how to setup the Devonfw environment, so you have everything setup to start working on your first project based on Devonfw.

The Devonfw environment contains all software and tools necessary to develop applications with Devonfw.

== Pre-requisites

In order to setup your environment, you need the following pre-requisites:

* Internet connection (including details of your proxy configuration, if necessary)
* 2GB of free disk space
* The ZIP containing the latest Devonfw distribution

== Download
Download latest Devonfw distribution from https://coconet.capgemini.com/sf/frs/do/listReleases/projects.apps2_devon/frs.devon_distribution[our Teamforge site].

== Prepare the workspace

1. Unzip the Devonfw distribution into a directory of your choosing. The path to the directory should contain no spaces, to prevent problems with some of the tools.

1. Run the batch file "create-or-update-workspace.bat".

This will configure the included tools like Eclipse with the default settings of the Devonfw distribution.

The result should be as seen below

1. If you use a proxy to connect to the Internet, you have to manually configure it in the following tools:

*Maven*

Open the file "conf/.m2/settings.xml" in an editor

image::images/download-install/devon_guide_environment_setup_3_proxy_maven.png[,scaledwidth=80%]

Remove the comment tags around the <proxy> section at the beginning of the file.

Then update the settings to match your proxy configuration.

If your proxy does not require authentication, simply remove the <username> and <password> lines.

*Sencha Cmd*

Open the file software/Sencha/Cmd/default/sencha.cfg in an editor

image::images/download-install/devon_guide_environment_setup_5_proxy_sencha.png[,scaledwidth=80%]

Search for the property definition of "cmd.jvm.args" (around line 45).

Comment the existing property definition and uncomment the line above it.

Then update the settings to match your proxy configuration.

If your proxy does not require authentication, simply remove the "-Dhttp.proxyUser", "-DhttpProxyPassword", "-Dhttps.proxyUser" and "-Dhttps.proxyPassword" parameters.

*Eclipse*

Open eclipse by executing "eclipse-main.bat".

In the Eclipse preferences dialog, go to "General - Network Connection".

Switch from "Native" to "Manual"

Enter your proxy configuration

You now have a working Devonfw environment.

You can find example projects inside `workspaces\examples`. In the next section you will learn how to run the Devonfw example application.
