<body>
<form method="post" action="WEBSERVICE_URL" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <table align="center" border="1" bordercolor="black" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
        <tr>
            <td>Select File:</td>
            <td>
               <input type="file" multiple="true" name="uploadedFile" size="100" />
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td>
               <input type="file" multiple="true" name="uploadedFile" size="100" />
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <input type="submit" value="Upload File" />
