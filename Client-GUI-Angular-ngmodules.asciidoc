# OASP4JS ng-modules
+oasp4js+ provides https://angularjs.org/[AngularJS] modules which address typical challenges in Single Page Applications (SPA), such as authentication and authorization (A&A), internationalization (i18n), etc. which are not directly addressed by AngularJS or other frameworks out of the box. These solutions are built on top of industry proven practices.

* link:Client-GUI-Angular-OASP-Security[oasp-security] - a simple yet powerful solution to A&A in SPAs
* oasp-i18n - handles translations in SPAs 
* link:Client-GUI-Angular-OASP-UI[oasp-ui] - a thin wrapper over http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/[UI Bootstrap] and https://github.com/urish/angular-spinner[angular-spinner] which combines them making applications more responsive
* oasp-mocks - enables you to easy test your modules which depend on the other `oasp4js` modules
