## Welcome to Devonfw

Welcome to *Devonfw*, the Devon Framework. This is a product of the CSD industrialization effort to bring a standardized platform for custom software development within Capgemini APPS2. This platform is aimed at engagements where clients do not force the use of a determined technology so we can offer a better alternative coming from our experience as a group.

The current version of the framework is oriented at development of web applications based on the Java EE programming model using the Spring framework project as the default implementation. The main idea is not to create a monolithic framework but to offer helpers to develop applications with proven patterns. Devonfw tries to be close to standards and not relying too much on custom implementations. In this way, the ideas can be re-used on other implementations such as on a Java EE pure solution (that is, with no Spring involved). Furthermore Devonfw comes with a series of development guides, tutorials and a reference application you can derive from. Devonfw is making extensive use of standards and existing products and not relying too much on technical custom components implemented by CG.

## Devonfw, the package

Devonfw contains:

 - Implementation blueprints for a modern cloud-ready server and a choice on JS-Client technologies (either open source AngularJs or a very rich and impressive solution based on commercial Sencha UI).

 - Quality documentation and step-by-step tutorials.

 - Highly integrated and packaged development environment based around Eclipse and Jenkins. You will be ready to start implementing your first customer-specific use case in 2h time.

 - Iterative eclipse-based code-generator that understands "Java" and works on higher architectural concepts than Java-classes.

 - Example application as a reference implementation.

 - Support through large community + industrialization services (Standard Platform as a service) available in the iProd service catalog.

The following picture shows main building blocks of the platform.

Devonfw uses a state-of-the-art open source core reference architecture for the server (today considered as commodity in the IT-industry) and on top of it an ever increasing number of high-value assets that are Capgemini IP. Why do we use an open source core?: in some countries of the SBU clients only accept open source stacks (most to mention customers who want to stay vendor-independent by principle), so being open is a market need. This also is the rationale for providing a open source reference architecture for the client built with AngularJs (open source itself). The picture above shows the open-source parts of devonfw on the left.

## Devonfw and Open Source

Devonfw is composed of an Open Source part that can be freely used by other people and proprietary addons which are Capgemini IP and can be used only on Capgemini engagements.

The Open Source part of Devonfw is called OASP (Open Application Standard Platform) which started as an initiative of the German BU (Apps evolve). This project offers both a server side solution (based on Spring) and an AngularJS solution for client side.

Having an Open Source foundation is an advantage on clients that donâ€™t want to be tied to an internal framework of a company like Capgemini. Since all the code is provided, the client is free to evolve it freely.

OASP itself is based on other established Open Source framework such as Spring, CXF or Hibernate. Adopting best practices and being enriched by the experience of our community of experts.

## Contributing to Devonfw

Devonfw Platform is organized in a way that it is easy for you to contribute. Therefore we have chosen to use github - the number one platform for social coding - which provides lean processes and great tooling. Currently most repositories are marked as private, hence invisible to you. You can send an email from your Capgemini account with your github login to the devonfw team if you want to get access. Please ensure your real name is set in your github account or your login is matching your Capgemini CORP login. You will be also added to our Capgemini OASP mailing list (see contact).

In order to contribute code we use git and github pull-requests. Lead developers can directly commit to the git repository while (later) everybody can clone and fork the repository and create pull-requests. These can be reviewed, commented and discussed and finally integrated (or rejected).

We are very happy to receive contributions from projects or individual experts. Before you invest your time and work into a larger change or contribution please get in contact before, to ensure that you will not waste your energy (somebody else might already work on the same thing, etc.). To get in touch and discuss with us please meet us in Yammer.
